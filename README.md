# NootBot
A Discrod Bot written in C#. Uses many APIs; arguably, more than anyone needs, objectively, more than anyone wants.

I've been using Discord for quite a while now and decided that it'll be cool to make my own bot.
Since the project im currently working on is frozen due to classified issues, this will be a pet project.


What is NootBot?
---------------------
A bot generally has a few different purposes in Discord: chat, music, permissions, intergrations
I intend to use NootBot mainly as a music bot, but a chat bot might be nessisary for me to learn Discord.Net
